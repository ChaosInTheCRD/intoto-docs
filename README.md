- You can read the current version of the specification [here](https://github.com/in-toto/docs/blob/master/in-toto-spec.md) 
- The latest stable version (0.9) is [here](https://github.com/in-toto/docs/blob/v0.9/in-toto-spec.md).

## Examples and Demos

There are a couple of repositories within this organization that you can use to
play around and better understand in-toto. Here's a list of them along with a
brief description

- [demo](https://github.com/in-toto/demo) This is a very basic dummy supply
  chain example to help you understand the in-toto python toolchain. We
  recommend getting started here.
- [kubectl-in-toto](https://in-toto/kubectl-in-toto). Inside of this repository
  you will find a demo to test a kubectl in-toto plugin to scan containers in
  your kubernetes deployment against in-toto metadata.
- [demo OpenSUSE](https://github.com/in-toto/demo-opensuse). This repository
  uses the OpenSUSE build toolchain to exemplify how in-toto could be
  integrated inside of OpenSUSE-based distros.
- [totoify-grafeas](https://github.com/in-toto/totoify-grafeas) this repository
  explains how you could use in-toto to secure grafeas metadata and use grafeas
  as a transport for in-toto links and layouts.

## Other informative repositories

Along with this Docs repository, the in-toto enhancements
